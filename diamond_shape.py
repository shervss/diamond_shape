# Purpose: A program that generates a diamond shape using the "*" character, based on an odd integer "n".

n = 5  # Change this value to test with different odd integers

# Check if n is an odd integer
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("Please provide an odd integer.")
else:
    # Calculate the number of rows for the top half and the bottom half
    rows = n // 2 + 1
    
# Print the top half of the diamond
# Print the bottom half of the diamond
